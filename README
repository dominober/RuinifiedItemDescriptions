Ruinified Item Descriptions
Attempts to rephrase item names and descriptions in the base game and Survivors of the Void to be more similar to new item names and descriptions in Seekers of the Storm.

Item effect clarity is dubious at best.

Clarification
This is not meant to insult or hold malice towards the developers at Gearbox who were clearly just working with the resources they had, this is purely made in parody and more for the simple enjoyment of trying to transform the inconsistencies into a humorous language of sorts for the rest of the game. I appreciate what they are trying to do and hope this is a start to what will hopefully be wonderful additions to the game.

Special Thanks
- Thank you to...
  - Zenithrium, swuffâ˜…, Slipskip, TheTimesweeper, saucy.wench, rob, as well as some friends and the rest of the SS2 Team for permitting me to subject them to some of these.
